# projects_site

*(Overview)*
Collection of a few projects, including the previous tools.
Tip Calculator, Currency Converter, Clothing Store, Photo Gallery and Spotify embeds.
All connected to the same index.html and navbar.

A shameful amount of Claude AI is still being used, but I'm also learning something from it, even if it is mostly just what to study further/brush up on.

*(Section updates)*
_ Gallery _
Wrapped in a carousel

_ Clothing Store _
This was the main new addition.
Mostly worked on filters, filter tags and the sorting function.
Basic selection methods are still making me think twice.
NEXT STEP: create a shopping cart and a quantity incrementer on each card,
the card/title linking to the full product page.

*(General language learning notes)*
_ HTML _
Learning about what can be created by JS is exciting, but I want to get more consistent with it.
Some things are templated from JS, and others are manually created in HTML.
Worth learning when each is appropriate (it seems that project scope/scale plays into this).

_ CSS _
Bootstrap can be weird to work with, but it's teaching me that laying out a basic grid might take priority over logic, and even most HTML content.
It'll make positioning so much easier to deal with later.

_ JS _
A lot of this seems to boil down to the different ways to find data and repurpose it. 
The different ways to do it, however, are something I need more practice with.
Not to mention the nesting and ordering. (function scope?)
